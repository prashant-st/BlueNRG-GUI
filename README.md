BlueNRG-GUI
======
Python Bluetooth LE Graphical User Interface
for real-time synchronized data acquisition on Linux.
The project was developed on a Raspberry Pi.

The GUI uses bluepy, tkinter and matplotlib as its core modules.
Up to five devices can be connected and recorded from simultaneously.
All data is recorded and can be visualized in real-time.
Features were implemented to automatically reconnect to the devices upon disconnection or bad connection timing.

This repository is part of the Activity Recognition based on Movement project, which is a complete open-source hardware and software solution of wearable BLE accelerometers + gyroscopes allowing activity recognition.
